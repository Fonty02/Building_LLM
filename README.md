# Building LLM from scratch

Documenting and sharing the code developed as I progress through the book [*Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)*](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch?a_aid=raschka&a_bid=4c2437a0&chan=mm_website) by Sebastian Raschka. This repository serves as a hands-on companion to the book, with code implementations that follow the chapters and concepts presented in the text.
